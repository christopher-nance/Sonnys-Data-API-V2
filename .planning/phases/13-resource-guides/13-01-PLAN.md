<objective>
Create guide infrastructure and write usage guides for the 4 standard resources (Customers, Items, Employees, Sites).

Purpose: Provide per-resource usage documentation with realistic code examples so developers can use each resource without reading source code. These are standard-depth guides — Phases 14-15 will deep-dive into Transactions and Account resources.
Output: 4 guide markdown pages in docs/guides/ and updated mkdocs.yml nav with Guides section.

# Existing docs structure:
@mkdocs.yml
@docs/index.md

**Tech stack available:** mkdocs-material, mkdocstrings[python]
**Established patterns:** mkdocs build --strict for verification, Material slate theme, src layout paths
**Constraining decisions:**
- [Phase 12]: show_source: false and heading_level: 2 for clean autodoc rendering
- [Phase 12]: Google docstring style with merge_init_into_class

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Guides nav section to mkdocs.yml and write Customers and Items guides</name>
  <files>mkdocs.yml, docs/guides/customers.md, docs/guides/items.md</files>
  <action>
1. Update mkdocs.yml nav to add a Guides section between Home and API Reference:
   ```yaml
   nav:
     - Home: index.md
     - Guides:
         - Customers: guides/customers.md
         - Items: guides/items.md
         - Employees: guides/employees.md
         - Sites: guides/sites.md
         - Giftcards: guides/giftcards.md
         - Washbooks: guides/washbooks.md
         - Recurring Accounts: guides/recurring.md
         - Transactions: guides/transactions.md
     - API Reference:
         - Client: api/client.md
         - Resources: api/resources.md
         - Models: api/models.md
         - Exceptions: api/exceptions.md
   ```

2. Create docs/guides/customers.md:
   - Title: "Customers"
   - Overview: what the customer resource represents (car wash customers with contact info, loyalty data)
   - Methods section with `list(**params)` and `get(customer_id)` — show signature, describe return type, key fields
   - Code examples: list all customers, filter by date (startDate/endDate params), get customer detail by ID, access nested Address fields
   - Return models: CustomerListItem (customer_id, first_name, last_name, phone_number, is_active, created_date) and Customer (full detail with address, email, loyalty_number, birth_date, allow_sms)
   - Note about auto-pagination (list fetches all pages automatically)
   - Tip: link to API Reference for full model field list

3. Create docs/guides/items.md:
   - Title: "Items"
   - Overview: wash items/products catalog with pricing and department info
   - Methods section with `list(**params)` — list-only resource, no get()
   - Code examples: list all items, access sku/name/department_name/price_at_site fields, filter or group items by department
   - Return model: Item (sku, name, department_name, price_at_site, cost_per_item, is_prompt_for_price, site_location)
   - Note about auto-pagination

Each guide should follow a consistent structure:
- H1: Resource name
- Overview paragraph
- H2: Methods — with method signatures in code blocks and description
- H2: Examples — realistic Python code blocks showing common usage patterns
- H2: Models — brief description of return types with key fields, link to API Reference for complete fields
- Use admonition blocks (tip, note, info) for pagination notes and helpful tips
  </action>
  <verify>mkdocs build --strict passes (will warn about missing guide pages referenced in nav, which is expected until all 8 are created — verify the 2 created pages render correctly by checking build output)</verify>
  <done>mkdocs.yml has Guides nav section with all 8 resources listed, docs/guides/customers.md and docs/guides/items.md exist with methods, examples, and model descriptions</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write Employees and Sites guides</name>
  <files>docs/guides/employees.md, docs/guides/sites.md</files>
  <action>
1. Create docs/guides/employees.md:
   - Title: "Employees"
   - Overview: employee records with clock entry tracking
   - Methods section with `list(**params)`, `get(employee_id)`, and `get_clock_entries(employee_id, *, start_date=None, end_date=None)` — the custom method is the highlight of this resource
   - Code examples: list employees, get employee detail (active status, start_date, phone, email), fetch clock entries with date range, iterate clock entries showing clock_in/clock_out/regular_hours/overtime_hours
   - Return models: EmployeeListItem (first_name, last_name, employee_id), Employee (full detail with active, start_date, phone, email), ClockEntry (clock_in, clock_out, regular_rate, regular_hours, overtime_eligible, overtime_rate, overtime_hours, was_modified, site_code)
   - Note: get_clock_entries flattens the API's nested weeks/clockEntries structure into a flat list
   - Note: start_date/end_date are keyword-only arguments, passed as startDate/endDate to API

2. Create docs/guides/sites.md:
   - Title: "Sites"
   - Overview: car wash site locations associated with the API credentials
   - Methods section with `list(**params)` — list-only, non-paginated resource
   - Code examples: list all sites, access site_id/code/name/timezone fields
   - Return model: Site (site_id, code, name, timezone)
   - Important note (admonition): Sites is NOT paginated — returns all sites in a single API call, unlike other resources
   - Tip: site codes are used as filter parameters in other resources (e.g., transactions startDate/endDate + site)

Follow the same guide structure established in Task 1.
  </action>
  <verify>mkdocs build --strict — may still warn about 4 missing guide pages (giftcards, washbooks, recurring, transactions) but the 4 created pages should build without errors</verify>
  <done>docs/guides/employees.md and docs/guides/sites.md exist with methods, examples, and model descriptions; mkdocs build processes all 4 guide pages without errors on those pages</done>
</task>
