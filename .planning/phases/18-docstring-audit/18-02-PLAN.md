<objective>
Add docstrings to all Pydantic models for standard and account resources.

Purpose: The API reference models page (docs/api/models.md) renders every model via mkdocstrings. Currently all 22 models in this scope show no description. Adding class docstrings makes the auto-generated docs useful.
Output: Docstrings on all Customer, Employee, Item, Site, Giftcard, Washbook, and Recurring models.

# Reference for what mkdocstrings renders:
@docs/api/models.md

**Established patterns:** Google docstring style, camelCase alias → snake_case attributes
**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 12: Google docstring style configured in mkdocs.yml
- All models inherit SonnysModel with camelCase alias generation

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add docstrings to Customer, Employee, Item, and Site models</name>
  <files>src/sonnys_data_client/types/_customers.py, src/sonnys_data_client/types/_employees.py, src/sonnys_data_client/types/_items.py, src/sonnys_data_client/types/_sites.py</files>
  <action>
Add Google-style class docstrings to each Pydantic model. Each docstring should be 1-3 lines explaining what the model represents and when it's returned. Do NOT document individual fields (mkdocstrings renders those from type annotations). Do NOT add Args/Attributes sections — the Pydantic fields self-document via the rendered signature.

**_customers.py (3 models):**
- `Address`: "Mailing address for a customer."
- `CustomerListItem`: "Summary customer record returned by ``client.customers.list()``. Contains identifiers, name, phone, and active status."
- `Customer`: "Full customer profile returned by ``client.customers.get(id)``. Includes address, contact details, loyalty info, and SMS opt-in status."

**_employees.py (3 models):**
- `ClockEntry`: "A single clock-in/clock-out record for an employee. Returned by ``client.employees.get_clock_entries()``."
- `EmployeeListItem`: "Summary employee record returned by ``client.employees.list()``. Contains name and employee ID."
- `Employee`: "Full employee profile returned by ``client.employees.get(id)``. Includes contact info, active status, and start date."

**_items.py (1 model):**
- `Item`: "A menu item (wash package, product, or service) returned by ``client.items.list()``. Includes SKU, pricing, and department info."

**_sites.py (1 model):**
- `Site`: "A car wash site/location returned by ``client.sites.list()``. Contains the site code, name, and timezone."
  </action>
  <verify>python -c "from sonnys_data_client.types._customers import Customer, CustomerListItem, Address; print(Customer.__doc__); print(CustomerListItem.__doc__); print(Address.__doc__)"</verify>
  <done>All 8 models across 4 files have class docstrings. Docstrings are concise, mention the method that returns them, and follow Google style.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Add docstrings to Giftcard, Washbook, and Recurring models</name>
  <files>src/sonnys_data_client/types/_giftcards.py, src/sonnys_data_client/types/_washbooks.py, src/sonnys_data_client/types/_recurring.py</files>
  <action>
Add Google-style class docstrings to each Pydantic model. Same approach: 1-3 lines, what it represents, when it's returned. No field-level documentation.

**_giftcards.py (1 model):**
- `GiftcardListItem`: "A giftcard liability record returned by ``client.giftcards.list()``. Contains card number, value, amount used, and site code."

**_washbooks.py (6 models):**
- `WashbookTag`: "An RFID tag or barcode associated with a washbook account."
- `WashbookVehicle`: "A vehicle linked to a washbook account."
- `WashbookCustomer`: "Customer info embedded in a washbook or recurring account detail."
- `WashbookRecurringInfo`: "Recurring billing details embedded in a washbook detail. Includes billing amount, next/last bill dates, and trial status."
- `WashbookListItem`: "Summary washbook record returned by ``client.washbooks.list()``. Contains ID, balance, status, and sign-up date."
- `Washbook`: "Full washbook detail returned by ``client.washbooks.get(id)``. Includes customer, vehicles, tags, and recurring billing info."

**_recurring.py (7 models):**
- `RecurringStatus`: "A status entry (status name + date) in a recurring account's history."
- `RecurringBilling`: "A billing entry in a recurring account's payment history. Contains charge amount, date, and last four digits of the credit card."
- `RecurringListItem`: "Summary recurring account returned by ``client.recurring.list()``. Contains ID, plan name, status, balance, and billing site."
- `Recurring`: "Full recurring account detail returned by ``client.recurring.get(id)``. Includes customer, vehicles, tags, billing history, and status history."
- `RecurringStatusChange`: "A status change event returned by ``client.recurring.list_status_changes()``. Records old/new status, date, employee, and site."
- `RecurringModificationEntry`: "A single modification entry with name, date, and optional comment."
- `RecurringModification`: "A recurring account with its modification history. Extends :class:`Recurring` with a modifications list. Returned by ``client.recurring.list_modifications()``."

  <done>All 14 models across 3 files have class docstrings. Docstrings mention the client method that returns each model and describe what the model represents.</done>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `python -c "import sonnys_data_client"` succeeds
- [ ] All 22 models have class docstrings (spot-check with `__doc__`)
- [ ] Docstrings follow Google style and mention return context
- [ ] No model field definitions were modified
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All 22 Pydantic models for standard and account resources have class docstrings
- Docstrings are concise, accurate, and mention the client method that returns them
- No breaking changes to model definitions
