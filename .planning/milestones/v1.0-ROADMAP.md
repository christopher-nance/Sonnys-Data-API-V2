# Milestone v1.0: Initial Release

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-10
**Phases:** 1-10
**Total Plans:** 17

## Overview

Build a pip-installable Python module that wraps the Sonny's Carwash Controls Data API with a resource-based interface, Pydantic models, built-in rate limiting, and auto-pagination. Starting from package scaffolding, we layer in HTTP transport, error handling, rate limiting, and response models before implementing resource classes for each API endpoint group — culminating in a polished, pip-installable package.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
**Goal**: Establish the Python package structure with pyproject.toml, src layout, SonnysClient class shell, and core dependencies (requests + pydantic)
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Package scaffolding and SonnysClient class

### Phase 2: HTTP Transport & Errors
**Goal**: Implement the HTTP session layer with auth header injection, request/response methods, custom exception hierarchy, and mapping of all API error types to client exceptions
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Exception hierarchy
- [x] 02-02: Error body parsing and status mapping (TDD)

### Phase 3: Rate Limiting
**Goal**: Implement per-instance sliding window rate limiter (20 req/15s), automatic backoff on 429 responses, and retry logic
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Sliding window rate limiter (TDD)
- [x] 03-02: HTTP request method with 429 retry (TDD)

### Phase 4: Response Models
**Goal**: Define Pydantic v2 models for all API response types — transactions, customers, items, giftcards, washbooks, recurring accounts, employees, and sites
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Transaction and customer models
- [x] 04-02: Item, giftcard, washbook, and recurring models
- [x] 04-03: Employee and site models

### Phase 5: Resource Framework
**Goal**: Build the base resource class with reusable list/get method patterns and auto-pagination logic (offset/limit loop using total count)
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 4
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Base resource class and auto-pagination (TDD)

### Phase 6: Standard Resources
**Goal**: Implement resource classes for Customers (list, get), Items (list), Employees (list, get with clock entries), and Sites (list)
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Customers and Items resources
- [x] 06-02: Employees and Sites resources

### Phase 7: Account Resources
**Goal**: Implement resource classes for Giftcards (list, get), Washbooks (list, get), and Recurring accounts (list, get, status history)
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Giftcards and Washbooks resources
- [x] 07-02: Recurring resource with status history

### Phase 8: Transaction Resources
**Goal**: Implement the transaction resource with all endpoints — list, list by type, get detail, and v2 list
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: Transaction list, by-type, and detail
- [x] 08-02: Transaction v2 list endpoint

### Phase 9: Batch Job System
**Goal**: Implement the transaction batch job flow — POST load-job, poll get-job-data, auto-poll loop with configurable timeout and interval
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 09-01: Batch job submission and polling

### Phase 10: Packaging & Distribution
**Goal**: Finalize pip-installable package from GitHub, polish logging configuration, run integration smoke tests, ensure clean install experience
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: Package finalization and install testing

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- PEP 639 SPDX license format for forward-compatible packaging
- Python 3.10+ native type syntax (no typing module imports)
- Keyword-only args for APIStatusError (prevents positional mistakes)
- time.monotonic over time.time for rate limiter (immune to clock changes)
- Exponential backoff 1s/2s/4s for 429 retry
- SonnysModel with ConfigDict(populate_by_name, alias_generator=to_camel)
- ListableResource/GettableResource as independent mixins
- functools.cached_property for resource accessors
- hatchling build directly (hatch wrapper has Windows env var issue)
- %-style logger formatting for lazy evaluation

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed 6 Pydantic model fields that API returns as null but were required
- Fixed pagination crash when API returns null for total count
- Fixed field name mismatches: discount->discounts, discount->discountAmount, RecurringModificationEntry fields
- Corrected Giftcards API path to match typo in actual API (/giftcard-liablilty)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
